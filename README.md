# COMP 6000 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

Auburn University COMP 6000 Final Project

Brief Intro: 
We designed an apartment website with JSP, CSS, JS, XML, SQL. It has a modern front page, a fashion gallery page, a regular contact page, as well as a functional login page and a register page with JSP-SQL interaction. After login, there is a user panel for user to interact with the apartment website feature. 

For more information, please contact our team!
